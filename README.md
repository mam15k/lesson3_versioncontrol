## Project Description:
This assignment was a little more tough than the first assignment. Its just because it is such a new way of coding for me, like using cloud9. Using github was interesting and a little frustrating at the same time, just because it is so new to me. 

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I really liked "git help" although I didnt use it in this lesson, I have a feeling I will use it in the future. 
2. I learned to not procrastinate especially if you are having computer problems.
3. I learned that "git init" is the first command that needs to be used, you cant use any other commands until "git init" is used.
